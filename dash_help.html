<h2>What is the EDSA dashboard?</h2>
<p>
The <strong>EDSA dashboard</strong> visualises the results of EDSA’s research into data science skills in Europe, and allows you to investigate the data yourself.
</p>
<p>
The results will help us to assess the demand for data science training in Europe and create new learning materials to help keep Europe ahead in this crucial domain.
</p>
<p>
The results of the research will directly influence the training and curriculum we create!
</p>
<p>
We want to collect data from every European country and every sector to do this.
</p>

Take a look at the <strong>EDSA trend tracker</strong> at the bottom of the dashboard. It collects over 2000 data points each day from LinkedIn. We’re searching for key data science terms in advertised job profiles so that we can see the most advertised data science skills.
